# Open Horizon Documentation
The purpose of this repository is to document my experience working on the OpenCircuits project and what I have learned.

## Changing the Example Circuits
The first issue that I solved was to fic the example circuits for OpenCircuitsEE; initially the example circuits were from the digital version of OpenCircuits, and were not meant for the analog version, so whenver you clicked on the sample circuits, it would give you an error. I fixed this by simply creating various example circuits and replacing the .circuit files with the ones I made within the analog version of OpenCircuits.

Circuit 1: Voltage Divider/ Nodal Analysis Example:
